# Statistical Analysis of Sleep Efficiency Using Regression Models

An R project that examines the impact of various lifestyle factors on sleep efficiency using statistical modeling and regression analysis. The study evaluates different predictors, applies model selection techniques, and assesses model performance through diagnostic tests.

This project was developed in **March 2023**.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performs descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand data distribution.
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Tests individual predictors to determine their relationship with sleep efficiency.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Builds a more comprehensive model incorporating multiple factors.
- **Model Selection**: Uses stepwise regression, Adjusted R², and BIC to select the best predictor combination.
- **Diagnostic Tests**: Includes residual analysis, Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation, and ANOVA for significance testing.
- **Prediction & Forecasting**: Generates sleep efficiency predictions for new data points with confidence intervals.

## Report Generation

The analysis.html file is the final report generated from analysis.rmd using R Markdown. The .rmd file contains the code and methodology used for the analysis, which can be re-run or modified to generate updated results.
